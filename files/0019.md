## 🐻‍❄️ About MindsDB

MindsDB is an open-source platform that helps developers build custom AI solutions with their data. Recently, MindsDB launched AI-Data Minds - turnkey private AI systems that work like LLMs but answer questions and engage in conversations using enterprise data.

## ⚔️ The challenge

The challenge for this quest is to create a new `AI-Data Mind` using the GUI or the Python SDK. The challenge will follow a points-based system:

| Points | Action |
| --- | --- |
| 15 | You create an original app that uses `AI-Data Mind` and you open source it. |
| 15 |  You connect your own dataset(s) to AI-Data Mind. |
| 10 | You create a high quality demo to show how your app uses AI-Data Mind. |
| 10 | You submit a feedback questionnaire about your experience. |
| 50 | You find and report an unknown bug or glitch in Minds that you can replicate. |

➡️ There are two **important rules**:

1. You **shouldn’t** use MindsDB's [sample datasets](https://docs.mdb.ai/docs/sample-databasehttps://docs.mdb.ai/docs/sample-database).
2.  You can submit multiple bug reports as long as they are unique and have not been reported by other users.

➡️ Here are some datasets you can use and we recommend:

- **Any dataset in [HuggingFace’s dataset index](https://huggingface.co/datasets)**.
- **Any dataset in [Kaggle’s dataset repository](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets).**
- **✨ Your own datasets or datasources ✨**


### **💰 Claiming the loot**

To claim rewards,

1. You need to collect a minimum of 50 points.
2. The app you submit must be your own. However, you can build on top of a previous quest submission.
3. If you write a blogpost, the content must be your own. Blog posts that are evidently generated with ChatGPT or similar tools will be disqualified.
4. If you find a bug, you must fill out the [Bug Report Form](https://form.typeform.com/to/thdRp7Oj) and start a discussion in [MindsDB’s Slack Server](https://mindsdb.com/joincommunity), channel `#minds`.
